    Added support for updating action state through the new
    ``openstack optimize action update`` command. This feature allows
    operators to manually change action states. The command
    supports the following options:

    * ``--state <state>`` - New state for the action (required)
    * ``--reason <reason>`` - Optional reason for the state change

    Currently, the only use case for this update is to Skip an action
    before starting an Action Plan with an optional reason by setting
    the state to SKIPPED:

    $ openstack optimize action update --state SKIPPED --reason "Manual skip" <action-uuid>

    This feature requires Watcher API microversion 1.5 or higher.

upgrade:

    The maximum supported API version has been increased from 1.1 to 1.5
    to support the new action update functionality. This change maintains
    full backward compatibility with existing deployments.
